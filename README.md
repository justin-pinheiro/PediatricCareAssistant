# Pediatric Care Assistant

## Context 

### Internship

This project was created during my internship at Presidency University, Bangalore (https://presidencyuniversity.in/) from June 17th, 2024 to August 9th, 2024. 

I implemented this mobile app under the supervision of Blessed Prince Sir, computer science professor at Presidency University.

### Project

The original project description was the following:
"Babies born very premature or those with cerebral palsy often have additional needs, for example, a gastric tube. Parents and family members are generally unfamiliar and need a lot of help and assistance. Information about usage and ongoing care is not readily available. There is a need for helping parents navigate the maze of information. Goal: A multilingual educational app (android/iOS) with editable content for parents of children with long-term disability."

### Goals

- Developping a complete mobile application from scratch
- Getting familiar with Android Studio IDE
- Apply Java in a large-scale project
- Leverage AI in mobile apps
